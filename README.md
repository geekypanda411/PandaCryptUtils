# PandaCryptUtils
Simple Android App for Base64 encoding decoding and generating hashes of strings.
Started looking at how android apps are made, decided this was a much more useful app to make than a simple Hello World, Will add more functionality, hashing algorithm support and maybe in future native support for these hash functions.
Also maybe even some symmetric key cryptography stuff!
